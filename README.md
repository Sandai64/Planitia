# ReSkolae

> ReSkolae is a simple, efficient, no-bullshit alternative to the Skolae app, which is used across 10 different schools.

### Rationale

The current Skolae app is flawed. Its ergonomics are left to be desired and the app will often crash for no obvious reason.

It doesn't focus on accessibility, and often chooses hard-to-read color combinations.
Not only that, but notifications are often delayed - or might simply never arrive altogether.

This is unacceptable. You deserve better from this organization. Which is why I tasked myself with creating a better, simpler and more reliable alternative.
